title: 10 Weeks 10 Games - Tower Defence
---
Inspired by the classic Flash game series Bloons Tower Defense, this has several waves of enemies try to move along the path. The player has to place towers near the path to shoot the enemies before they can reach the end. Money is earnt by destroying the enemies and is used to place more towers.

Similar to Shmup, this was lacking in content, only having 3 towers and 2 enemy types, but again formed the base gameplay of a tower defence game.
