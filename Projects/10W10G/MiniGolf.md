title: 10 Weeks 10 Games - Mini Golf
---
A simple top-down golf game which challenges the player to get the ball to the hole in the fewest number of shots. The player would drag their finger back from the ball to control its direction and speed.

This one was a bit more complete in content than the previous games as it had 9 levels, which let me experiment with adding hazards, such as moving blocks.
