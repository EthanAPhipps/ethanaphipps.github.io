title: 10 Weeks 10 Games - Puzzler
---
The final game in the [10 Weeks 10 Games]({% link Projects/10W10G/Intro.md %}) exercise was an attempt at making something like Puyo Puyo, however I didn't manage to get too far with it, even compared to some of the games that are lacking in content, so the gameplay is rather minimal.

By this point I was unfortunately rather tired and, as I never really set myself a schedule, I didn't spend enough time on this to make it as good as I would've liked.
