title: 10 Weeks 10 Games - JRPG
---
This was inspired by the game Summoner's War that I played at the time, and is an example battle scene from a JRPG.

The characters' action bars fill up according to a speed stat, then when it's that character's turn the bars stop filling up as the character takes an action. Each character has 3 skills they can use, a basic attack and 2 powerful skills with separate cooldowns. This system was lifted from these mobile JRPG games as it fits neatly into a mobile control scheme versus a more menu-based system seen in a game such as Final Fantasy IX.

While it is just a framework for a battle scene I could see it easily having progression systems added that modify the player's characters' stats or skills or being integrated as the combat for a larger game.
