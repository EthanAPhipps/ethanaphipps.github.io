This was a challenge I set myself during the summer of my second year of university, in which I tried to make 10 small Android games over 10 weeks. These are being written as a retrospective as I did not develop this website until years later, so may have some inaccuracies.

Over the years during sixth form and early university I’d given making games in Unity a go, but never managed to get one to anywhere near finished state, so I resolved to change that and make that the core of the challenge; instead of making a single game that I would never finish I’d make several small prototypes that I would build some sort of minimum viable product of.

Doing this proved to be a valuable experience as it challenged me to stick to the weekly deadline and forced me to engage with parts of games I typically didn't consider in the prototypes, such as the title screen.

However, in hindsight, I also burnt myself out with this, as the first game I worked on I spent too much time on, and, while I achieved what I wanted, couldn’t keep up the momentum with the later games, which lacked in content. If I were to do this again I would use proper planning tools like a kanban board to avoid this burnout, which I didn’t know of at the time.

In order from first to last, I made these games:

2. [Dot Eater]({% post_url  2018-08-01-10W10G-DotEater %})
