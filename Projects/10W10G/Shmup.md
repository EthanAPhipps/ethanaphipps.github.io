title: 10 Weeks 10 Games - Shmup
---
The third game I made was a twin-stick shooter "Shoot 'em up", or "shmup", game, it features the player fighting increasingly challenging waves of enemies.

Learning from the previous game, I didn't spend as much time on it, which led to it being pretty simple with a few waves and only two enemy types. This would be something that I'd end up doing with these games. I'd develop the core systems but not much content, unfortunately to the detriment of the game itself.
