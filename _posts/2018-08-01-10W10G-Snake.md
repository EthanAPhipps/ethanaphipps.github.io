The first game that I tried to make as part of my [10 Weeks 10 Games]({% post_url  2018-08-01-10W10G-Intro %}) exercise was a simple snake game. I chose this as I knew that I'd be using parts of Unity I hadn't used before, so wanted to have a game that I could make quickly, and spend my time setting up everything around it.
The game itself doesn't have any extra flourishes, it's as simple as Snake can be, with a 10x10 grid and swipe controls. It also has simple scoring system that encourages rapid collection of fruit by providing more score if the player recently collected some fruit.
