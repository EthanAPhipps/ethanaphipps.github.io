title: 10 Weeks 10 Games - Adventure RPG
---
Inspired by the game RuneScape, I set out to make a simple game where the player would interact with the environment similar to any point-and-click adventure game.

Unfortunately I did not develop much content for this beyond what is shown in the screenshots, and it's more of a proof of concept, as the player could fix the bridge and enter the building on the other side, but that was it.

*Screenshot of the game, the player interacted with the sign. The following text is readable: "The sign reads "Bridge broken, find another route". You think that you could fix this with some logs."*

*Screenshot of the game showing the player's inventory, there is an axe and two logs*
