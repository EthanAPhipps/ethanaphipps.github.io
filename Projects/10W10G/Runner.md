title: 10 Weeks 10 Games - Runner
---
This was a simple 2D infinite runner style game. The longer the player goes on the more points they earn, with just a single jump input. The game would spawn obstacles in front of the player that had to be correctly maneuvered through, and the player could collect coins for more score.

I had previously tried to make an infinite runner in Unreal using blueprints in sixth form but never managed to really complete it, so this was my a second attempt at one. I learnt some lessons from that, even if they were rather obvious in hindsight, such as to have the player not move and instead the environment move towards the player.
